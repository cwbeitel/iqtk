# Inquiry Research Infrastructure

#### Design Document

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to make available to the broader scientific research community a comprehensive biological data science research infrastructure with primary project goals that include the following (todo discuss more):

1. Reproducibility

2. Robust automation

3. Abstraction and increased leverage

4. Structured data warehousing and partial unification of community data space

For a comprehensive exposition of the problem and requirements we refer the reader to the DARPA Synergistic Discovery and Design [call for proposals](https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=6d8044bb740578b628515f8bf70f5733).

## Architecture

The current plan for the architecture is as follows:
