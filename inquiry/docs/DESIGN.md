# Inquiry Research Infrastructure

##### Design and strategic roadmap

## Preliminaries

#### Symptoms of a problem

- $1B and 10y to take a drug to market?
- Scientific reproducibility is shamefully low
- Developing and sharing new methods is very hard and expensive, whether computational or molecular

#### Broader vision and objective context

- Make biology research easy (5-10 year timeframe)
- Frame in terms of building capacity for hybrid cyber-physical optimization (simulation, lab digitization, method development & deployment platform)

#### Emerging tech context

- Revolution in robotic control
- Optimization algorithms and hardware as a cloud service
- Digital microfluidics
- Advancement of analog microfluidics
- Immunotherapies!

## Core objectives

#### Computational infrastructure

Core needs include the following:

- Reproducibility of analyses and laboratory operations
- Robustness of infra both computational and laboratory
- Increased leverage through abstraction
- Some form of central integration of "knowledge"

For a comprehensive exposition of the problem and requirements we refer the reader to the DARPA Synergistic Discovery and Design [call for proposals](https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=6d8044bb740578b628515f8bf70f5733).

The cloud architecture overview is effectively this, borrowed from Google:

See [TODO.md](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/TODO.md).

## Organizational strategies

- There is space for everyone. It's irresponsible to exclude people who stand to benefit the project (and who can follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) for personal or political reasons.
- The curriculum of challenge problems is the root driver. Operate in ZPD to design current objectives and for those derive short-term key results of the correct form. Then within this context (which in turn in the context of a broader vision of related projects), use agile.
