# Deployment

Deployment of the Inquiry Toolkit consists of the following primary parts:

* Deployment and configuration of a kubernetes cluster, more [here](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/developer/deploy-cluster.md).
* Deployment of IQTK workflow and other services to the kubernetes cluster, more [here](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/developer/deploy-services.md)
* Deployment of the IQTK API, more [here](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/developer/deploy-api.md)

A recommended pre-requisite for these steps is the developer quickstart, [here](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/developer/ddeveloperuickstart.md).
