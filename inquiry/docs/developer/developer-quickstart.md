# Getting started

You want to contribute to the `iqtk` project! This will get you started. Here we'll be doing the following things:

* Point to some important design, conduct, and planning documents.
* Configuring your local machine for development.

## Important documents

First of all, please take a careful read through the [code of conduct](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document. This code applies to all communication and conduct relating to this project on or off-line.

Secondly, please refer to the primary project [design document](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/DESIGN.md). This document is a work in progress but provides the necessary initial context for the project.

Work on this project will be conducted around a class model of git issues and pull requests. If you are interested in contributing please first open a dialog with members of the project via a git issue (creating a new one if necessary). This process is important to give light to potential new features as well as to maintain an efficient division of labor.

## Configuring your development machine

Inquiry has the following dependencies that must be installed before proceeding:

* Bazel (and in turn Java 8)
* The `gcloud` command-line utility
* The `kubectl` command-line utility

These dependencies can be installed manually or using the [developer setup script](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/tools/developer_setup.sh).

## Next steps

Once you're all set up you many want to do one of the following:

* [Deploy the inquiry toolkit on the Google Cloud](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/blob/master/inquiry/docs/developer/deploy.md)
* [Review open issues](https://github.com/iqtk/iqtk/issues)
