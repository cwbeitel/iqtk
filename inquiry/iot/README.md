# iot prototype

**Status: Prototype**

Currently primarily focused on MiSeq(IOTDevice) and MiSeqSequencingRun(object) for ability to (1) mock the pattern of files generated by a sequencing run and (2) parse from such a directory the config that was used to create the run.

### Testing

Run tests with the following:

```bash
bazel test //inquiry/iot/...
```
